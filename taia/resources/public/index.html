Like the best TEDTalks, they're personal and provocative, and designed to spread great ideas. TED Books are typically under 20,000 words \u2014 long enough to unleash a powerful narrative, but short enough to be read in a single sitting.  \n\nThe success of TED Talks has demonstrated that millions of people around the world are hungry to absorb new thoughts and perspectives. With more demands than ever on people's time, we think many will welcome the chance to absorb a TED Book when a spare hour becomes available. \n\nThe TED Books app allows us to embed audio, video, and social features into each book, broadening the depth and detail of each work. These additional multimedia features suit the wide-ranging creative palette of our contributors, many of who use photography, audio, and video in addition to the printed word to fully express their ideas.\n\nTED Books can be purchased individually, or readers can subscribe and automatically receive a new ebook every two weeks. Those who subscribe within 90 days of our July 19, 2012 launch \u2014 whom we call Founding Subscribers \u2014 can download our entire back catalog at no charge. \n\nTED is a nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It started out (in 1984) as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, Design. Since then its scope has become ever broader. Along with two annual conferences \u2014 the TED Conference in Long Beach and Palm Springs each spring, and the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh in the summer \u2014 TED includes the award-winning TEDTalks video site, the Open Translation Project and TED Conversations, the inspiring TED Fellows and TEDx programs, and the annual $1 million TED Prize. On TED.com, we make the best talks and performances from TED and partners available to the world, free. More than 1,000 TEDTalks are available, with more added every day. All of the talks are subtitled in English, and many are subtitled in various languages.\n\nTED Books offers a three-month, six-book subscription for $14.99, automatically renewed until canceled. Every two weeks, we'll have a new title available for download. Founding Subscribers - those who join within 90 days of our launch date - may also download titles from the back catalog free.\n\nIndividual books are available for $2.99 to non-subscribers.\n\nSUBSCRIBER'S AUTOMATIC-RENEWAL FEATURE: Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will automatically be charged at the same price for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current three-month period unless you change your subscription preferences in iTunes. You can manage your subscriptions through your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.","price":0,"currency":"USD","artistName":"TED Conferences","averageUserRating":3,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ted-books\/id511071050?mt=8&uo=4","search":"TED Books","ipadScreenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a1922.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/070\/Purple\/v4\/62\/bd\/cf\/62bdcfa5-22da-54c1-f391-f792431efb7d\/mza_7013510486799381403.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a1769.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/077\/Purple\/v4\/b1\/64\/f2\/b164f28c-cede-175c-6453-8aa8a81cda86\/mza_7321165199398766412.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a413.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/118\/Purple\/v4\/70\/97\/5c\/70975cc2-14cf-d8a7-1216-281824c83391\/mza_1110015335402219425.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a397.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/070\/Purple\/v4\/3c\/a3\/f4\/3ca3f43e-b5c0-3bcf-97bb-03236e759563\/mza_5037556982290470575.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a1117.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/112\/Purple\/v4\/66\/81\/0d\/66810df7-6d98-2d5b-cb86-693e9f0da0bd\/mza_6500582239550929656.1024x1024-65.jpg"],"screenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a1929.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/079\/Purple\/v4\/3a\/d8\/a1\/3ad8a17c-f0dc-edcb-891d-a1a3e6366427\/mza_7726852624540119630.png","http:\/\/a1861.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/110\/Purple\/v4\/a7\/b2\/fc\/a7b2fc8e-4276-4fb3-c83a-8130d2f80f08\/mza_2670582745815447159.jpg","http:\/\/a652.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/107\/Purple\/v4\/54\/6c\/47\/546c4750-c29f-adbf-cd79-78fdd87797f4\/mza_5039328444735701743.jpg","http:\/\/a1648.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/094\/Purple\/v4\/98\/b4\/d5\/98b4d5c2-cae8-2703-e446-ed5a0a96e111\/mza_1574412564873592113.jpg","http:\/\/a504.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/066\/Purple\/v4\/3c\/9a\/79\/3c9a7992-cf50-669a-0e7a-b1248c971d55\/mza_2603327187755929288.jpg"]},"519363162":{"_id":"519363162","_rev":"20-00bc93a0322616934e36e9436bc7b825","name":"Track 8","image":"downloads\/iPad519363162.png","thumbnail":"downloads\/min\/iPad519363162.png","type":"iPadApp","year":"2012-05-04T04:35:15Z","genres":["Music","Entertainment"],"description":"Your music library doesn't have to look ordinary.

More important, it works like a charm.\" - John Fuller, Macworld.com (writing about version 1.0 . . . and version 2.0 is even better!)\n\nDan Bricklin's\u00ae Note Taker makes it easy for you to quickly write down and organize names, phone numbers, addresses, shopping lists, notes, and more. You write directly on the screen with your finger. It's like having a stack of note cards and a pencil always with you.\n\nPages are flexibly organized by date\/time last modified, tags, favorites, and more, with thumbnail images of part of each page to help you find them later.\n\nYou can write in large letters on the screen rather than trying to make tiny motions like a pencil. Note Taker automatically shrinks your writing so you can fit a lot of text on the screen. You just keep writing and Note Taker automatically adds new writing next to the old. To quickly correct mistakes, it has a multi-level undo button as well as an eraser -- just drag your finger over the page to erase the \"ink\" under it. \n\nThe \"paper\" your writing ends up on is equivalent to about a 3\"x5\" card. You can write anywhere on it, so you can cross out shopping items as you buy them, go back and underline, draw diagrams, and more. You lay out the page the way you want. Use any markings: stars, underlines, and characters in any language. Create multiple pages. \n\nYou can email your notes as JPEGs, or save them to a photo album. \n\nWith this full version, you can email multiple pages as a PDF. You can also create \"Typed\" pages with the keyboard and organize them with the ink pages. On ink pages you can bring up a keyboard later to transcribe what you wrote into contact information that can be added to the Address Book with the tap of a button or pasted into other apps. This full version does not have a limit on the number of pages and does not have a watermark on the JPEGs.\n\nNote Taker was designed and programmed by Dan Bricklin, the same person who 30 years ago came up with VisiCalc, the pioneering electronic spreadsheet that made working with numbers on a personal computer so easy. \n\nSee the Note Taker YouTube channel: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/DBNoteTaker -- MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THE \"How to write on the screen\" video or follow the \"Try It\" tutorial in the app itself to learn the \"trick\" to writing.","price":1.99,"currency":"USD","artistName":"Software Garden","averageUserRating":3,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/note-taker\/id342284707?mt=8&uo=4","search":"Note Taker","ipadScreenshotUrls":[],"screenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a1119.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/001\/Purple\/2d\/5c\/e1\/mzl.kvbnlmyd.jpg","http:\/\/a1087.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/032\/Purple\/6e\/d6\/63\/mzl.scmyjqgo.jpg","http:\/\/a1677.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/053\/Purple\/64\/84\/be\/mzl.jalrycwc.jpg","http:\/\/a1178.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/032\/Purple\/ee\/ac\/23\/mzl.jjeqabnl.jpg"]},"361285480":{"_id":"361285480","_rev":"20-81e8243ec0cdbcbf3c1d57747cd54bd9","name":"Keynote","image":"downloads\/iPad361285480.png","thumbnail":"downloads\/min\/iPad361285480.png","type":"iPadApp","year":"2010-04-01T08:40:46Z","genres":["Productivity","Business"],"description":"Keynote is the most powerful presentation app ever designed for a mobile device.

There's an app for that! Air Display turns your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch into a wireless display, to extend or mirror your computer screen.\n\n\u201cHave you ever looked at your iPad and thought, \u2018That would make a great second monitor for my computer!\u2019?\u201d \u2014Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cThe app worked like a charm by providing more screen real estate.\u201d \u2014USA Today\n\n\u201cAir Display lets you take advantage of the iPad\u2019s native touch screen, meaning you can use your finger to move your mouse around.\u201d \u2014TIME\n\n\u201c10 Apps That Make Magic on Your iPad\u2026 Never again miss a new Twitter post, Facebook post or stock market move.\u201d \u2014New York Times\n\n\u2014 FEATURES \u2014\n\nAir Display not only gives you a wireless computer screen extender, but also works as a tablet input device. You can use your finger to draw directly on the screen's surface. Try it with a calculator, painting tool, or music control surface! Simple gestures allow you to operate the right mouse button and scroll wheel.\n\nAir Display's performance is extremely responsive, employing a unique dynamic compression algorithm. On a typical Wi-Fi network, mouse cursor refreshes are indistinguishable from a wired mouse.\n\nOn Mac OS X (and soon on Windows), if your iOS device has a Retina display, you can choose to operate at normal or double resolution. On Lion, you can even enable \u201cHiDPI mode.\u201d HiDPI, a built-in Mac OS X feature that renders UI elements at double resolution, is absolutely stunning on a Retina display. (NOTE: the Retina MacBook Pro does not support HiDPI on external displays.)\n\nAir Display works in both landscape and portrait configurations. Just rotate your screen, and it automatically reconfigures. When you rotate the screen, or disconnect and reconnect, your windows are automatically repositioned appropriately so you don't have to drag them back onto the Air Display screen.\n\nYou can connect to Air Display from both Mac and Windows. And because it's a universal app, it works on an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch.\n\nAir Display provides a virtual keyboard and mouse input on the iOS device. Air Display supports video-out to your TV or Monitor, either via Apple's AirPlay or with an appropriate adapter cable.\n\nSome great uses for Air Display:\n\n\u2022 General: Fill your Air Display screen with utility windows like Twitter, Facebook, email, or calendar.\n\u2022 Graphic design: Make Photoshop and Illustrator usable on your laptop by putting your tool palettes on the iOS screen.\n\u2022 Music: Use your iOS screen as a wireless control surface for Logic or Pro Tools.\n\u2022 Programming: Use the extra display area for such auxiliary development tools as Console, Terminal, and the Debugger.\n\u2022 Business: Move all of your iWork and Office palettes and inspector windows onto Air Display, and let your document fill the screen.\n\u2022 Share: Use your iOS device's video adapter to share your screen on TVs, monitors and projectors in your boardroom or classroom.\n\u2022 Amaze your friends by playing Flash animations on an iOS device!\n\nOn first launch, Air Display presents easy instructions for downloading and installing the companion Air Display Connect software for your desktop computer.\n\n\n\u2014 COMPATIBILITY \u2014\n\nMAC OS X\nTo connect to a Mac, Air Display requires 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or later, on an Intel CPU. Both 32-Bit & 64-Bit systems are supported. (NOTE: On Lion & Mountain Lion, third-party video drivers, including Air Display\u2019s, have some issues on these specific 15\" and 17\" MacBook Pro models: Late 2008 through Mid 2009, and Mid 2010. Please see avatron.com\/lion for details and effective workarounds.)\n\nWINDOWS\nTo connect to a Windows PC, Air Display requires Windows XP (32-bit only), or Vista or 7 (32-bit or 64-bit). Windows 7 Starter edition is not supported. (NOTE: Aero and DirectX will be disabled while connected to Air Display and re-enabled upon disconnection.)\n\nNETWORK\nYour computer and iOS device must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.","price":9.99,"currency":"USD","artistName":"Avatron Software, Inc.","averageUserRating":3,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/air-display\/id368158927?mt=8&uo=4","search":"Air Display","ipadScreenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a1906.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/120\/Purple\/v4\/9a\/f5\/71\/9af5718c-ca0f-d0bc-e063-28f53c8405d7\/mzl.zphcnqel.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a505.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/073\/Purple\/v4\/04\/9e\/4d\/049e4d70-dbf0-6c4d-aa11-2046d3016cb6\/mzl.kdhkangs.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a378.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/063\/Purple\/v4\/56\/97\/dc\/5697dc1a-97d9-bc83-66d3-4e7bab3feb2f\/mzl.cvslaqkd.1024x1024-65.jpg"],"screenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a493.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/063\/Purple\/v4\/6f\/2b\/d3\/6f2bd375-c175-82d9-7099-677a79936b5e\/mzl.mywgdcdw.png","http:\/\/a200.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/102\/Purple\/v4\/b4\/2f\/4f\/b42f4fca-4a7a-cf39-1a51-d3b2067f6758\/mzl.zokhjawv.png","http:\/\/a320.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/062\/Purple\/v4\/10\/76\/d8\/1076d8e1-019f-3302-0a2c-5d8dfb1ceeea\/mzl.ivemtmqi.png"]},"388924653":{"_id":"388924653","_rev":"9-0d687da08a49ad79bec9c3972f77873d","name":"Monster.com Jobs","image":"downloads\/iPad388924653.png","thumbnail":"downloads\/min\/iPad388924653.png","type":"iPadApp","year":"2010-08-29T07:50:39Z","genres":["Business","Productivity"],"description":"Stay connected to the premier job search website to discover the latest jobs that meet your needs.

No hardware is required, just this app plus a software download on your office server. Be connected in minutes, simply and securely with an enterprise-class VPN featuring dial-on-demand and certificate authentication.\n\nRequirements:\niSimplyConnect Server must be installed on your office network. Please check with your IT Administrator.\n\nKey Features:\n-          No hardware to buy or configure\n-          Try complete service for free before you buy\n-          Simple to setup, out-of-the-box secure\n-          Scalable to thousands of iOS devices, great for just a few\n-          Real network connection to your office, not just remote control\n-          Connect over Cellular or WiFi\n-          Web Managed via a simple UI\n\n\nOnce the app is installed, create your account then download and install the VPN software onto a Windows server. This can be any recent version of Windows but must be a domain member or controller. The VPN software uses outbound SSL to connect with iSimplyConnect so usually does not need any firewall changes and does not mind if your office IP address is not static. The server software is small and won't even require a reboot for installation.\n\nWhen installed, you will be able to create VPN profiles for use by your organizations iOS users. In addition to an x.509 certificate, these profiles will contain an automatic Dial-on-Demand setting that will enable the VPN whenever it is needed. Configuration is over-the-air with no need for cables - just a PIN to activate your devices.\n\niSimplyConnect is ideal for any organization looking to connect iOS devices to internal applications or servers that have previously only been accessible via local WiFi, less secure PPTP VPNs or PC remote control. As a VPN, iSimplyConnect is much more than a one-to-one remote control product that requires everyone to leave their PC on all the time. So long as your server is online, your iOS devices are too.\n\nNo data is ever stored by iSimplyConnect - unlike cloud storage services that just cache your data on the internet, access is provided to your network and your data.","price":0,"currency":"USD","artistName":"Asavie Technologies Ltd.","averageUserRating":2.5,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/isimplyconnect\/id477969286?mt=8&uo=4","search":"iSimplyConnect","ipadScreenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a517.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/075\/Purple\/v4\/97\/ca\/d3\/97cad331-55e7-6215-2697-8a57abd517cc\/mza_2713534490820879177.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a1376.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/103\/Purple\/v4\/5a\/1c\/2a\/5a1c2a51-00a1-ebdb-692c-c79604ab3f4a\/mza_4757814100174960309.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a1243.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/084\/Purple\/v4\/59\/19\/8a\/59198a9b-3c1c-5dc0-cd10-072127d38103\/mza_8286249927472950023.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a478.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/110\/Purple\/v4\/05\/8d\/3c\/058d3cea-185f-4c2f-98a3-2e8ce192722a\/mza_8328591642684985066.1024x1024-65.jpg"],"screenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a970.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/116\/Purple\/v4\/56\/e0\/f3\/56e0f33d-160e-c160-8622-70cedb3a7b50\/mza_7126987117691315551.png","http:\/\/a1504.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/094\/Purple\/v4\/08\/72\/a4\/0872a439-9b02-ac94-efae-7406d5ccf238\/mza_470965708704620355.png"]},"508238074":{"_id":"508238074","_rev":"9-504a0ccb0909f8bdca0ae068c2107432","name":"FileMaker Go 12 for iPhone","image":"downloads\/iPad508238074.png","thumbnail":"downloads\/min\/iPad508238074.png","type":"iPadApp","year":"2012-04-04T11:49:27Z","genres":["Business","Productivity"],"description":"FileMaker Go 12 lets you and your team access databases created by FileMaker Pro 12 on your iPhone.\n\nDO MORE ON THE GO\nTackle any task on your iPhone with FileMaker Go.

More than 18,000 libraries worldwide offer best-selling and classic titles via OverDrive, so use the \u2018Get Books\u2019 feature in the app to find a library near you. \n\nHow do library eBooks and audiobooks work? \n\nDigital titles from your library are borrowed just like print material. Once you find your library using \u2018Get Books,\u2019 you can browse your library\u2019s digital collection on the web, check out a title with a valid library card, and download the title directly to your iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. \nWhile borrowing the digital title, you can enjoy it using the app\u2019s eBook reader or audiobook player. Each EPUB eBook and MP3 audiobook that you check out has a lending period. The title automatically expires in the app at the end of the lending period, so there\u2019s never a late fee. There\u2019s even a handy countdown clock built into the app so you know how long you have to read or listen before the title expires.\n\nWhat happens if a digital title is already checked out?\n\nJust like with physical material from the library, you can join a waiting list.  All you need to do is enter your email address and you\u2019ll receive an alert when the title is available for check out.\n\nDon\u2019t want to wait? Many libraries offer thousands of EPUB eBook downloads that are always available. Just check for the \u2018Additional eBooks\u2019 link at the bottom of the digital collection homepage and you can get a free eBook from your library that\u2019s yours to keep\u2014without a lending period. You\u2019ll discover timeless books and find yourself reading more than ever before with this diverse collection.\n\nYou can also download DRM-free EPUB eBooks from other online sources and read them in the OverDrive Media Console app.\nWant more books? \n\nEach library builds a custom digital collection of eBooks and audiobooks specifically for their local community. Contact your library and let them know that you are using OverDrive on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch and would like to see additional titles in the digital collection.","price":0,"currency":"USD","artistName":"OverDrive, Inc.","averageUserRating":4,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/overdrive-media-console-library\/id366869252?mt=8&uo=4","search":"OverDrive Media Console \u2013 Library eBooks and Audiobooks","ipadScreenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a341.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/116\/Purple\/v4\/59\/42\/f6\/5942f67f-37f9-383d-9ed8-4178fc90371c\/mzl.bslrudum.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a1356.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/093\/Purple\/v4\/6f\/78\/50\/6f7850e6-60e2-e733-f732-0df4ae12e875\/mzl.rbvedrse.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a1479.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/073\/Purple\/v4\/30\/14\/48\/3014489b-d317-a154-ce5e-7652b3b189d9\/mzl.zzqkctvd.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a787.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/078\/Purple\/v4\/10\/51\/c0\/1051c0b0-96f2-173a-1442-6db458df2732\/mzl.femyetqi.1024x1024-65.jpg","http:\/\/a1973.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/077\/Purple\/v4\/7a\/8f\/4e\/7a8f4e27-32d1-c67f-6b4d-4678578c4e8c\/mzl.mgwuhjeh.1024x1024-65.jpg"],"screenshotUrls":["http:\/\/a1050.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/102\/Purple\/v4\/76\/6a\/cf\/766acf5d-01e7-200b-9437-e815c7e233fa\/mzl.ukvsywlw.png","http:\/\/a720.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/084\/Purple\/v4\/83\/99\/a1\/8399a1c1-2680-ed6a-d58a-db68c12371c7\/mzl.fgebougw.png","http:\/\/a72.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/091\/Purple\/v4\/9e\/b5\/77\/9eb57783-e59c-97fc-4e72-707327a8a021\/mzl.ljveqphj.png","http:\/\/a1384.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/080\/Purple\/v4\/3e\/2c\/7c\/3e2c7c60-f9fb-66d6-45f2-ad59f489e39e\/mzl.vghykger.png","http:\/\/a693.phobos.apple.com\/us\/r1000\/111\/Purple\/v4\/1a\/4e\/cf\/1a4ecfff-7283-fc50-7afd-ad42173391e9\/mzl.eegodipa.png"]},"368195233":{"_id":"368195233","_rev":"5-7c1f2f344e6e618f9f29c3834a82cf27","name":"Books- 23,469 classics to go.","image":"downloads\/iPad368195233.png","thumbnail":"downloads\/min\/iPad368195233.png","type":"iPadApp","year":"2010-04-30T05:52:17Z","genres":["Books","Education"],"description":"Like reading?

With more demands than ever on people's time, we think many will welcome the chance to absorb a TED Book when a spare hour becomes available. \n\nThe TED Books app allows us to embed audio, video, and social features into each book, broadening the depth and detail of each work. These additional multimedia features suit the wide-ranging creative palette of our contributors, many of who use photography, audio, and video in addition to the printed word to fully express their ideas.\n\nTED Books can be purchased individually, or readers can subscribe and automatically receive a new ebook every two weeks.

Along with two annual conferences \u2014 the TED Conference in Long Beach and Palm Springs each spring, and the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh in the summer \u2014 TED includes the award-winning TEDTalks video site, the Open Translation Project and TED Conversations, the inspiring TED Fellows and TEDx programs, and the annual $1 million TED Prize. On TED.com, we make the best talks and performances from TED and partners available to the world, free. More than 1,000 TEDTalks are available, with more added every day. All of the talks are subtitled in English, and many are subtitled in various languages.\n\nTED Books offers a three-month, six-book subscription for $14.99, automatically renewed until canceled. Every two weeks, we'll have a new title available for download. Founding Subscribers - those who join within 90 days of our launch date - may also download titles from the back catalog free.\n\nIndividual books are available for $2.99 to non-subscribers.\n\nSUBSCRIBER'S AUTOMATIC-RENEWAL FEATURE: Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
